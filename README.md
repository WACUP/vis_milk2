# vis_milk2
This is a modified release of the Milkdrop 2 (vis_milk2) Winamp visualisation plug-in. The changes are minor though may contain some bug fixes &amp; are primarily aimed at improving the Winamp plug-in integration with the requirements of being a bundled WACUP plug-in.

The Winamp 5.55 SDK as well as some of the newer Winamp 5.666 header files from <a target="_blank" href="https://getwacup.com/sdk/">here</a> are required to build this release. Additionally the last DirectX standalone SDK is required for header files, etc.
